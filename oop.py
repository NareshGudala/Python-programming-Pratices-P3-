#======================Object Oridented Programming=============================

'''

Class(template)
=> we will define class by using 'class' keyword
=> blue print to create a object
=> collection of objects is called class

'''

'''

Object
Physical entity(real)

=> an instance of a class
=> memory is created when it declared

'''


'''
==== self keyword =====
we can access the attributes and methods of the class(current class only)

'''

# class nans(): # class defination
#     def show(self):
#         print("Hai Pithapuram")

# # object name = class name() object creation    
# vi=nans()
# vi.show()


# class siva():
#     a=10

# #obj name=class name()

'''

=>   __inti__

=>  constructer are generally used for instantiating an object.
=>  The task of constructure is to initialize(assign values)
=>  To the data members of the class when an object of the class is created.
=>  In python the __inti__() method is called the constructor.
=>  an did=s always called when an object is created.

=> does'nt support mulitple constructor
